  <title>A library for editing typed command lines</title>
  <description>The Readline library provides a set of functions that allow users to
edit command lines. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The
Readline library includes additional functions for maintaining a list
of previously-entered command lines for recalling or editing those
lines, and for performing csh-like history expansion on previous
commands.
